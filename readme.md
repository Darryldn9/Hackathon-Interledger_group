There was an issue that lied in the way the front end was built as we used a different . The front end loads html template pages as api calls rather than pages part of a framework. So I am not actually sure how it handles dependencies from npm and node as it is all base HTML.

To implement recurring payments with Open Payments SDK and integrate it with a FastAPI backend, we would first gather the wallet addresses of both sender and receiver and store them in a database. Using FastAPI, we would then create endpoints to query this database for the necessary information. When a payment process is initiated, the FastAPI endpoint returns a JSON response containing the wallet addresses and other relevant details. This JSON data is used to initialize the Open Payments client, request payment grants, create incoming and outgoing payments, and handle token rotation to ensure secure and authenticated recurring transactions between the payer and payee wallets using the Interledger Protocol.
